# About Parselo

### What is it? 

Parselo is both an application and library. Meaning, once it is successfully built and tested it should be ready for both:

* Run as a standalone application

* Be incorporated into an existing application that uses GTK. Like a window widget of functionalities you can open from the menu of your application once it's integrated to do so. 

### What it does? 

It grabs logs about your application from the system journals and let you accomodate them or format as you wish.

### Why? 

This work started as a personal initiative to facilitate the readability of logs generated by Mir server and clients, but I think it would apply to any project that has several components interacting and generates detailed boost-logs.

### What can I do with it?

As a graphical interface it aims to facilitate the arrangement and filtering of what you want to see and how. The main idea is to avoid changing the code that generates those logs but instead parse them and arrange the view as you like.
