# About Parselo

### What is it? 

It's a graphical application that grabs specific logs from the system journals making use of known software for that job (see license section).

### Why? 

This work started as a personal initiative to facilitate the readability of logs generated by Mir server and clients.

What can I do with it?

As a graphical interface it aims to facilitate the arrangement and filtering of what you want to see and how. The main idea is to avoid changing the code that generates those logs but instead parse them and arrange the view as you like.

### But, I have installed `Logs` for that already, and it is great!

That's right. However it's focused on your hole system, and it is a project in a much more advanced stage of development.

Starting from there to adapt and customize it for my needs didn't seem to be the way to go (IMHO). Besides this is just a side project conceived as a path to become more familiar with the development of Mir. This is just some personal challenge made public.
